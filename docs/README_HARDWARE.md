# Hardware

## Introduction
Along with the mobile application, Fridge Buddy consists of a touchscreen device that is able to attach magnetically to refrigerator doors and provide the same user interface. Given the scope and software focus of this project, the resulting touchscreen hardware serves as a design concept rather than a complete prototype. For testing purposes and to emulate a custom hardware solution, a Samsung Galaxy A7 Lite tablet was chosen, along with a custom 3-d printed enclosure to house both the tablet and magnetic inserts. 

## Design Criteria
In designing the enclosure, the following aspects were prioritized:
- a minimal physical footprint
- allowing visibility for the tablet's front-facing camera
- allowing access for the usb-c charging port
- secure fit of the tablet
- secure fit of magnets
