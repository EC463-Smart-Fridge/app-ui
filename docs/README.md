# Fridge Buddy: Your Waste-Reducing Smart Refrigerator Companion
Food waste is a significant issue in the United States, with a substantial portion occurring as a result of grocery spoiling in households. Fridge Buddy aims to combat this problem by empowering users to manage food items efficiently and reduce food waste by transforming traditional refrigerators into smart appliances. Fridge Buddy is a mobile application and an easily mountable touchscreen that tracks item inventory, synchronizes data across multiple devices, notifies users when expiration dates are near, and suggests ways to help users best make use of their grocery items. Users will be able to easily view, add, remove, and update items using a touchscreen interface that easily mounts onto existing refrigerators, supported with an optional mobile application. The data displayed and modified between these two interfaces will be synchronized through a cloud backend, ensuring that user data is always up-to-date. Users will also be provided access to a recipe suggestion feature to help them more optimally use their existing food, prioritizing items that will soon expire. Fridge Buddy empowers users to better manage food at home, reduce waste, and save money on groceries using its low-cost, effective solution.

## Project Overview
The Fridge Buddy application comprises of a React Native frontend application for both the touchscreen refrigerator attachment and mobile devices. The application's storage and computational backend is powered by Amazon Web Services.

## Product Features

## Project State
Although we would add on more features if we had more time to work on the project, Fridge Buddy is largely in a completed state. We managed to complete the minimum viable product that we had intended, with reach goals such as creating a custom tablet and implementing receipt scanning ultimately becoming out of scope of the project timeline. Of course, though, there's always room for polishing.



Engineering Addendum (4000 - 12000 characters)

Please, please please work on your Githubs.  It should incldue an excellent README file explaining the project, algorithms you used and developed, demos, isntallation instructions, etc.  It should be a product quality GitHub.

Use a QR code for your poster.  

Also prepare a video demo.  Put a QR code for demo in your poster.


The Engineering Addendum is quick-start documentation written to any future team that may continue
to work on your project. This is where you outline the gotchas of your project, types of things to look out
for, the current state of the project, etc. The purpose of README.md is to save any future team weeks
of detective work just to get to where you are today. Think back to what types of things you had wished
you knew earlier, doing future teams a favor by passing that knowledge along.
